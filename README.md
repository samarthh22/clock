# React Clock & Stopwatch

This is a simple Clock and Stopwatch application built using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The goal of this project was to practice working with React state, timers, and basic UI layout.

The app has two main features:

- A real-time digital clock that displays the current time
- A stopwatch with start, stop and reset controls

The UI is kept minimal and clean, and the layout is responsive so it works on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Running the project

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The project is deployed on Vercel:
https://clock-samarthh22.vercel.app

Future Improvements, some things I may add later:

1)Lap functionality for the stopwatch
2)Theme switcher (light/dark mode)
3)Option to show multiple timezones
